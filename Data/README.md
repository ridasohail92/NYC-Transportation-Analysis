## Data

Included in this folder directly are Assane's 2020 Yellow Taxi and Ze Hong's Bicycle Parking Spots data sets. 

The remaining data sets (bus delays, MTA subway ridership, CitiBikes) are located in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J53fDUlPDNB1UReesDPt5KUDSMlLEnCv?usp=drive_link) and in the links provided in the research paper due to their size preventing us from directly uploading them to GitHub.
