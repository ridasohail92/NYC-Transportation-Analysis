## Project Status

In conclusion, our team has undertaken a thorough exploration of
various facets of New York City’s transportation system, shedding
light on the intricate dynamics of yellow taxi operations, bus delays,
subway ridership, and bike-sharing patterns. The data-driven
insights gleaned from our visualizations offer a glimpse into the
complexities of urban mobility in one of the world’s busiest cities.

By refining our visualizations and weaving them into a compelling
narrative, we aspire to provide residents and policymakers with a
nuanced understanding of the urban mobility landscape. Ultimately,
our goal is to empower individuals to make informed decisions about
their transportation choices while providing valuable insights that
contribute to the ongoing discourse on optimizing the transportation
infrastructure in New York City.
